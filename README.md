Metis Project 03

The project work is primarily done through 3 notebooks:  

1. "Project_03_Data"
    - Clean billboard chart dataset
    - Gather audio feature data from Spotify API
    - Create final dataset

2. "Manual_CV"
    - Created baseline models, perform gridsearch on best of those models

3. "Flask_App_Model"
    - Final model is tested and saved as pickle to be used in Flask App
    
There are also some supplementary notebooks that I worked on along the way:  

1. "Imblearn_CV"  
    - Cross-validation through imblearn pipeline approach
2. "Straightforward_Validation"  
    - Initial modeling: no cross-validation, just simple validation
3. "Project_03_Modeling"
	- Initial modeling with cross-validation
4. "Feature_Engineering"  
	- Make transformations to features and evaluate effect on metrics

The powerpoint slides are saved as "Final_Powerpoint"
